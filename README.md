# Chapter Notes

## Chapter 2: highlight

This chapter includes the basics of React applications can be built

* A server-less Hello World page has been created and a brief tryout of jsx
* Project set up including the nvm, Node.js, npm and Express
* Separate Script files and JSX transform to move the transformation to the build stage in the development. 

  - Issue encounter at this part, the working directory was messed up and when I try to deploy the page at localhost, the 404 error was kept coming. Finally, the final solution was managing the project package in the same directory as the development files.

* Set up the older Browser Support functions and install npm automate packages for development usage
